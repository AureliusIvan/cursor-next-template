{"id":"cursor-next-template-d1a","title":"Feature: Preserve chat history in AI dashboard","description":"**Problem:**\nChat messages in the AI dashboard (`app/(auth)/dashboard/ai/`) are currently stored only in-memory using the `useChat` hook from `@ai-sdk/react`. When users refresh the page, navigate away, or clear the chat, all conversation history is lost. This creates a poor user experience as users cannot reference previous conversations or continue discussions across sessions.\n\n**Location:**\n- `app/(auth)/dashboard/ai/page.tsx` - Main chat component using `useChat` hook\n- `app/(auth)/dashboard/ai/components/chat-header.tsx` - Clear button that wipes messages\n- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Chat API endpoint (doesn't persist messages)\n- `prisma/schema.prisma` - No chat-related models exist\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- Messages are managed entirely client-side via `useChat` hook state\n- No database persistence layer for chat sessions or messages\n- No API endpoints for saving/loading chat history\n- Chat history is not associated with authenticated users\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\n1. **Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):\n   - Create `ChatSession` model to represent conversation sessions\n     - Fields: id, userId (FK to User), title (optional, auto-generated from first message), createdAt, updatedAt\n     - Relation: User has many ChatSessions\n   - Create `ChatMessage` model to store individual messages\n     - Fields: id, sessionId (FK to ChatSession), role (user/assistant/system), content (text), metadata (JSON for attachments, tool calls, etc.), createdAt\n     - Relation: ChatSession has many ChatMessages\n     - Index on sessionId and createdAt for efficient queries\n\n2. **API Endpoints** (`app/api/chat/`):\n   - `POST /api/chat/sessions` - Create new chat session, return sessionId\n   - `GET /api/chat/sessions` - List user's chat sessions\n   - `GET /api/chat/sessions/[id]` - Get session with messages\n   - `POST /api/chat/sessions/[id]/messages` - Save message to session\n   - `DELETE /api/chat/sessions/[id]` - Delete chat session\n   - Modify `POST /api/chat/route.ts` to optionally accept sessionId and save messages\n\n3. **Frontend Integration** (`app/(auth)/dashboard/ai/`):\n   - Create `hooks/use-chat-history.ts` - Custom hook to manage chat persistence\n     - Load existing session or create new one on mount\n     - Save messages to database as they're created\n     - Handle session switching/creation\n   - Update `page.tsx` to:\n     - Initialize with sessionId (from URL param or create new)\n     - Load messages from database on mount\n     - Save messages after each send/receive\n     - Update session title from first user message\n   - Update `chat-header.tsx`:\n     - Add session selector/dropdown for multiple sessions\n     - Update \"Clear\" button to delete current session (not just clear state)\n     - Show session title if available\n\n4. **Authentication Integration**:\n   - Use `auth.api.getSession()` in API routes to get current user\n   - Associate all chat sessions with authenticated user\n   - Ensure users can only access their own chat sessions\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Add ChatSession and ChatMessage models\n- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Add session persistence logic\n- `app/api/chat/sessions/route.ts` - New file for session management\n- `app/api/chat/sessions/[id]/route.ts` - New file for individual session operations\n- `app/api/chat/sessions/[id]/messages/route.ts` - New file for message persistence\n- `app/(auth)/dashboard/ai/page.tsx` - Integrate history loading/saving\n- `app/(auth)/dashboard/ai/hooks/use-chat-history.ts` - New hook for persistence\n- `app/(auth)/dashboard/ai/components/chat-header.tsx` - Add session management UI\n- Migration file - Auto-generated by Prisma\n\n**Testing:**\n- Create new chat session and verify it's saved to database\n- Send messages and verify they're persisted\n- Refresh page and verify messages are restored\n- Create multiple sessions and verify they're listed correctly\n- Delete session and verify it's removed from database\n- Verify users can only access their own sessions\n- Test with attachments and tool calls (ensure metadata is preserved)\n- Test session title generation from first message","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-05T22:59:26.291885861+07:00","created_by":"ivan","updated_at":"2026-01-05T23:16:30.982120861+07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T23:16:30.982120861+07:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["database"]}
